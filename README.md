# Welcome Baby Packet Concept

## How can we welcome every new child born in Somerville? 

Team Somerville is brainstorming ideas &amp; welcoming questions around the idea of Welcome Baby Baskets. For families with newborns and young children, Somerville provides many resources and services to support families e.g., home visits, playgroups, early intervention/special education, childcare, pre-K programs, full-day kindergarten, etc. 

- How might the City better engage with the diverse families of Somerville?
- How might the City connect families to the services they need?

## Somerville's Vision: Maximizing Children's Potential

**Includes:**

- **"coordinated information & referral"**: *"single point of entry (both online and physical portals) where families with young children can easily access resources that meet their needs and receive answers to their questions"*

- *"collaboration and partnership among City/School and community groups"*
