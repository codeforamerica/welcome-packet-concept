# Welcome Baby Packet Concept

## How can we welcome every new child born in Somerville? 

Team Somerville is brainstorming ideas &amp; welcoming questions around the idea of Welcome Baby Packets. For families with newborns, Somerville provides many resources and services to support new parents e.g., home visits, playgroups, etc. How can the City better connect and engage with these families?
